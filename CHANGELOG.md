**v2.0.1**
- Maintenance release - No new features or bugfixes

**v2.0.0**
This release is the first where the library supports both browser and node environments from the
same package. We decided to deprecate the `rollbar-browser` npm package in favor of using the
`rollbar` npm package for all javascript environments. This single codebase now handles both
environments and therefore `require('rollbar')` can be used regardless of where the code is to be
run. The [node_rollbar](https://github.com/rollbar/node_rollbar) library is now deprecated in favor
of this library.

The major structural change in the library is that we no longer treat Rollbar as a singleton. In
order to report errors to Rollbar, one uses a particular instance of the Rollbar notifier. For
convenience, when loaded via the html snippet, we put the rollbar constructor onto the window at
`window.rollbar` and we put an instance on the window at `window.Rollbar` which has been
instantiated with the options set via `_rollbarConfig`. For most workflows, this change should not
be noticable. However, there are a few cases where one might run in to trouble.

- scope: this method no longer exists, it was arguably a hack to allow something like a new instance
  without having to instantiate something manually because a constructor was not exposed. Instead of
  using scope, it works just to create a new instance `var otherRollbar = new rollbar({...})`. The
  downside being that the options passed to the constructor must be a complete set of options, not
  just the ones you want to override which is how scope worked. This is a minor inconvenience to pay
  for the flexibility of having real lifecycle ownership over your rollbar instances.
- uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections: the choice to report uncaught exceptions and/or
  unhandled rejections is still made via a configuration parameter set in `_rollbarConfig` or in the
  options passed directly to the constructor. However, due to the nature of these handlers being
  global, we made the choice to only have one instance set as this handler. What this means is that
  if you create a new instance with the option `captureUncaught` set to true, that instance will
  take over as the uncaught exception handler. Similarly for `captureUnhandledRejections`. If you
  set either of these options to true in `_rollbarConfig` and use the snippet to load rollbar, then
  the convenience instance located at `window.Rollbar` will be setup as this handler.

  `[object Object]` (pr#249)

  - Customers should copy and paste the new snippet into their code.

**v1.4.0**
- Fix a bug, (introduced in v1.3) that caused Rollbar to generate an error when used with RequireJS.
  - Customers should copy and paste the new snippet into their code.

**v1.3.0**
- Add more strict JSHint options and fix errors/warnings.

**v1.3.0-rc.4**

- Remove sourceMappingURL comment due to browser bug concerns

**v1.3.0-alpha.4**
- Update CHANGELOG.md.

**v1.3.0-alpha.3**
- Remove repeated timer to send enqueued payloads.
- Change argument name in Stack() to fix uglify bug.
- Change __DEFAULT_ROLLBARJS_URL__ to use https.
- Set window._globalRollbarOptions when calling .configure().

**v1.3.0-alpha.2**
- Update missing dist/ files.

**v1.3.0-alpha.1**
- Build the library using webpack.
- Replace tracekit and use error-stack-parser.

**1.2.2**
- Added `nojson` distribution, for use on sites with a Content Security Policy that disallows `unsafe-eval`. (The standard distributions ship with a built-in JSON implementation, since external libraries, such as MooTools, sometimes break the brower's built-in JSON.) If you know that the built-in JSON is not being modified in your application, or you are disallowing `unsafe-eval`, use this distribution.

**1.2.1**
- Fixed bug where the global notifier not being used to atch event listener exceptions. (pr#70)

**1.2.0**
- Fixed AMD build to now return the notifier instance from the `init()` method.

**1.1.16 - EDIT: This version has been removed due to finding a bug that broke backward compatibility.**
- Optimized the AMD build to not create a Notifier instance until the `init()` method is called.

**1.1.15**
- Fix a bug where custom context functions that returned `undefined` were causing `Rollbar.wrap()` to throw an error.

**1.1.14**
- Fix a bug in IE8 where DOMException was being used even though it's not defined, (#62).

**1.1.13**
- Add `responseText` and `statusText` to the data reported by the jQuery ajax plugin, (pr#61).

**1.1.12**
- Fixes a bug where `DOMException` objects were not recognized as error objects. (#55).

**1.1.11**
- Fixes a bug where wrapped functions were crashing when a `null` callback was given to `removeEventListener()`, (pr#50).

**1.1.10**
- Pulls in the latest JSON-js changes that do not call `.toJSON()` if the method exists already. This was breaking because MooTools v1.2.4 sets `.toJSON()` to use a broken JSON stringify implementation.

**1.1.9**
- Always use the custom JSON implementation since some users are initializing a library that will overwrite a working `JSON.stringify()` with a broken one after Rollbar has checked for `JSON.stringify()` correctness.

**1.1.8**
- Added a callback function to `loadFull()` to support Segment.io's plugin model.

**1.1.7**
- Added `verbose` and `logFunction` options, (pr#42).

**1.1.6**

**1.1.4**
- Added the `enabled` flag to determine when we should enqueue payloads to be sent, (#28).

**1.1.3**
- Fixed a bug that was causing a stack overflow error in IE8, (#38).
- Shaved off a few bytes from the snippet's size.

**1.1.2**
- Fixed a bug that was causing `Rollbar.configure()` to incorrectly handle overwriting array configuration.
- Added in support for a `ignoredMessages` configuration option, (pr#35).
- Fixed a bug that was causing some `EventListener` objects to not be unbound, (pr#33).
- Updated the snippet with fixes.

**1.0.0-rc.11**
- Add support for whitelisting host names/domains, (pr#31).

**1.0.0-rc.10**
- Add support for using rollbar with Webpack/Browserify via `require("rollbar.require.min.js")` with examples.

**1.0.0-rc.9**
- Fixed a bug that caused a wrapped async handler to break if there was no callback provided.

**1.0.0-rc.8**
- Fixed a bug that created/used a global variable.

**1.0.0-rc.7**

**1.0.0-rc.6**
- Fixed a bug where items were sent in reverse order when queued
- Add `maxItems` global option. If defined, at most this many items per pageview will be sent. Default `0`, meaning "no limit".

**1.0.0-beta4**

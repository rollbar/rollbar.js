JSON is a light-weight, language independent, data interchange format.
See http://www.JSON.org/

The files in this collection implement JSON encoders/decoders in JavaScript.

JSON became a built-in feature of JavaScript when the ECMAScript Programming
Language Standard - Fifth Edition was adopted by the ECMA General Assembly
in December 2009. The json3.js file in this collection provides a fallback
implementation for obsolete web browsers that lack native JSON support.


json3.js: This file provides a comprehensive JSON implementation that works
across all browsers. It includes both stringify and parse methods that are
fully compliant with the JSON specification. The parse method uses a state
machine approach instead of eval, making it safe for use in environments
with Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. This is the only JSON
implementation file currently used by Rollbar.js.
